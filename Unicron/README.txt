Copy the 2 folders to your respective place that you had installed OCTGN.
Default path will be C:\User\*\AppData\Local\Programs\OCTGN\Data
Take note that * is the name you give to your PC.

Another way to find out where OCTGN is being installed, is to open up file explorer and go C: to search for it.
You should have alot of search results. Just look for a folder that is similar to the default path above. And into the folder, Data.

Once done, Load in OCTGN deck editor to have a check. The set name is Unicron.
Enjoy!
