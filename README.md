# fanbrew-octgn

This contains a slew of fan-brewed cards for Transformers the Trading Card Game.

To install, unpack the zip file over the top of your {OCTGN_HOME}/Data directory. A Fanbrew-Decks folder will be created in that directory containing various decks files that use these cards. 

This provides:

* Unicron: Powered by Primus: https://youtu.be/ZFMfQUzCDA8
* Alpha Trion Protocols: https://www.facebook.com/groups/alphatrionprotocols
* The ARK Spoilers: https://www.facebook.com/groups/thearktftcg
* Legendary Wave X: https://www.facebook.com/groups/290966152231660/user/100028177891994

Each card number begins with X:, allowing you to filter for Cards that don't contain "X:" to ignore custom cards. 

Cards may change, however the card id will not be changed so built decks should generally stay the same. Note that FortressMaximus knows nothing about these cards, and that if some of these end up in the base OCTN mod for Transformers TCG, there is no reason to expect it to support the same ids. i.e. Any decks built may not work if the custom cards are added to the default OCTGN.
